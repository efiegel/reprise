Run pytest with `--cov=reprise --cov-fail-under=100` whenever you make a code change.

Also keep these guildelines in mind when writing tests:
- single-purpose tests are ideal (multiple asserts are OK if they suit the test purpose)
- use parametrization when appropriate
- use existing fixtures if they're relevant
- update existing fixtures if it doesn't adversely effect other tests
