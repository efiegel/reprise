Tests should be just as clean as our code! Keep these guildelines in mind:
- single-purpose tests are ideal (multiple asserts are OK if they suit the test purpose)
- use parametrization when appropriate
- use existing fixtures if they're relevant
- update existing fixtures if it doesn't adversely effect other tests
