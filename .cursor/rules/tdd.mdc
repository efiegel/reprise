Run pytest on the appropriate file whenever you make a code change, and update, add, or remove tests as necessary to cover the changes.

Note that unit tests are in /tests/unit, integration tests are in /tests/integration.

Once everything looks good, run _all_ tests to be sure there were no regressions. Ensure complete coverage too, so run pytest with `--cov=reprise --cov-fail-under=100`.
